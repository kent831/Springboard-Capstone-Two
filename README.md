# Springboard-Capstone-Two

In this project, we are going to predict an individual's MBTI personality type based on their chat history. This dataset is retrieved from Kaggle which was collected from the PersonalityCafe forum. The datasets contains only 2 columns: "type" and "posts". Each row represents an individual's MBTI type and a collection of their posts in the forum. With this dataset, we will be using NLP to preprocess the data and try out different models that will lead to the best performance.

My goal in this project is to be a lot more familiar with dealing with text data and state-of-the-art methods in NLP.
